# AutoCorrect

A small Java AutoCorrect that fixes the following common spelling mistakes:
- Missing letters
- Too many letters
- Swapped letters

My CodeGym mentor also suggested to implement the Levenshtein method:
- Levenshtein distance

Example:
mySuggest("stdu") â†’ suggests: stud, study

Made as part of my CodeGym Java course practice
